🏒 NHL Live Stats Tracker

Description:
A personal project built with Python, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap that used the NHL API to fetch and display live game data. The goal was to compare player statistics — primarily between Juraj Slafkovský and Logan Cooley — and later integrate email notifications for scoring events.

The project is currently discontinued, but it served as a great exercise in working with real-time APIs, data parsing, and front-end integration.
